Welcome! I’m **Walid Mawass**, an evolutionary geneticist and quantitative biologist with a deep interest in how evolutionary processes unfold and interact across timescales — from rapid adaptation in contemporary populations to the long-term genetic dynamics that shape species persistence. My research is united by a central question: **What constrains the pace and predictability of evolution, and how can we best infer its operation from complex, structured, and noisy data?**

## Research Vision

I study the **evolutionary processes that generate and constrain biological diversity**, using a combination of **theoretical models**, **quantitative genetics**, and **statistical inference** applied to genomic and historical data, supplemented with computational simulations. My work spans multiple biological scales and methodological domains, with a common focus on how evolutionary dynamics are shaped by:

- **Environmental fluctuations and demographic change**
- **Genetic architecture and mutational constraints**
- **Structure and bias in genetic and phentoypic data**
- **Interactions between selection, environment, and plasticity**

I aim to contribute to evolutionary theory and its application by integrating **empirical studies**, **computational simulations**, and **statistical tool development**. A significant part of my work builds models that not only explain evolutionary patterns but also improve our capacity to predict future responses to environmental or demographic challenges — a goal with deep relevance to **conservation**, **public health**, and **evolutionary forecasting**.

## Selected Research Highlights

- Demonstrated how **genotype-by-environment interactions (G×E)** constrain responses to selection in human life-history traits, showing that adaptation rates can vary even under consistent selection pressures and heritability.
- Developed the concept of **mutational drought** as a novel driver of extinction vortices in small populations, using simulations to show that a lack of beneficial mutations, not just accumulation of deleterious ones, can accelerate population demise at long time scales.
- Applied **random matrix theory** to quantify bias in polygenic score–based inference, showing how residual population stratification affect interpretations of GWAS data.
- Developed a theoretical framework to analyze the effects of **unlinked background selection** on neutral diversity, integrating quantitative models with empirical estimates of genetic parameters to better understand the genome-wide patterns in non-model species.

## Methods & Tools

My work blends evolutionary theory with modern computational and statistical tools, including:

- **Bayesian and mixed-effects models** in R and Python
- **Forward-time simulations** using SLiM and tree-sequence recording with `tskit`
- **High-performance computing pipelines** and workflow automation
- **Quantitative genetic modeling** with pedigree and genomic data
- Statistical correction and modeling of **population structure** in GWAS and PGS analyses

I value open science and reproducibility, and I make a conscious effort to share data, code, and models where possible.

## Mentorship & Teaching

I am committed to mentoring students in **quantitative and computational biology**, helping them build strong foundations in modeling, data analysis, and interpretation. I’ve led and co-led graduate seminars, guest lectured on quantitative genetics, and supervised student projects from concept to publication. My teaching emphasizes active learning, collaborative inquiry, and the cultivation of intuitive scientific thinking.

## Service & Outreach

I believe that science should be **collaborative, inclusive, and publicly engaged**. I’ve served in leadership roles in organizations like the Genetics Society of America (GSA), facilitated workshops for international students, and mentored high school students in scientific experimentation and computational biology. These experiences reflect my commitment to equity, mentorship, and science communication across career stages and communities.
