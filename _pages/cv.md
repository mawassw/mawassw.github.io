Research Interests
======
My work investigates the genetic and statistical constraints that govern evolutionary processes across timescales. I combine population genetics, quantitative genetics, and statistical modeling to study:
- Rapid adaptation and evolutionary predictability in changing environments  
- The role of G×E, plasticity, and demography in shaping adaptation  
- Evolutionary rescue and extinction dynamics in small populations  
- Bias and confounding in polygenic adaptation and GWAS inference  
- Theoretical modeling of background selection and its effect on diversity

Skills
======
* **Programming Languages:** Python, R, Unix Shell, C, SQL  
* **Modeling & Simulation:** SLiM, msprime, tree-sequence recording with `tskit`  
* **Statistical Methods:** Mixed models (Bayesian & frequentist), GWAS, PGS, PCA, RMT  
* **Data Tools:** Jupyter, RStudio, Mathematica, Git/GitHub, Compute Quebec HPC  
* **Writing & Typesetting:** LaTeX, Markdown, HTML, Word  
* **Languages:** Arabic (native), English (fluent), French (fluent)
